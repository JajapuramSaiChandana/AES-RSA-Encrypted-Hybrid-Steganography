# AES-RSA-Encrypted-Hybrid-Steganography
The secret data is encrypted using Hybrid AES-RSA before embedding in the cover media using the LSB technique.
The private message is first encrypted using AES symmetric key and then embedded in the LSB of cover media. This approach ensures that the information is well-hidden within digital content, while encryption provides an additional layer of protection to prevent unauthorized access.
